## ‚úÖ Solution: Configure Gmail App Password

### Step 1: Prepare Your Gmail Account

1. **Use the Gmail account**: `aidiginext@gmail.com` (or another Gmail account you want to use)
2. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (required for App Passwords):
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Click on "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the setup process if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

1. **Go to App Passwords page**:
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Or navigate: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords

2. **Create a new App Password**:
   - Select app: **Mail**
   - Select device: **Other (Custom name)**
   - Enter name: **AIpath Studio Website**
   - Click **Generate**

3. **Copy the 16-character password**:
   - It will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` (with spaces)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Remove the spaces when copying
   - Example: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 3: Update .env.local File

1. **Open the file**: `.env.local` in the project root directory

2. **Replace the placeholder values**:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=aidiginext@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Replace**:
- `aidiginext@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
- `abcdefghijklmnop` with your 16-character App Password (no spaces)

3. **Save the file**

### Step 4: Restart the Development Server

**CRITICAL**: Environment variables are only loaded when the server starts!

1. **Stop the current server**:
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

2. **Start the server again**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for the server to fully start** before testing

2. Check that it contains `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
3. Restart the development server

---

**Solution**:
1. Open `.env.local`
2. Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with actual Gmail address
3. Replace `your-app-password-here` with actual App Password
4. Restart the development server

### Error: "Email authentication failed"
**Cause**: Invalid Gmail credentials or App Password

**Solutions**:

2. **Regenerate the App Password**:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Delete the old App Password

### Error: "Invalid login"
**Cause**: Using regular Gmail password instead of App Password

- **DO NOT** use your regular Gmail password
- **MUST** use a 16-character App Password generated from Google Account settings
- Follow Step 2 above to generate a proper App Password

---

### Error: "Network error"
**Cause**: Internet connection issue or firewall blocking SMTP

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try disabling VPN if you're using one
3. Check if your firewall is blocking port 587 or 465
4. Try using a different network

---

### Emails not arriving in inbox
**Possible causes**:
1. **Check Spam/Junk folder** - Gmail might flag automated emails
2. **Email addresses incorrect** - Verify `sales@aidiginext.com` and `aidiginext@gmail.com` are correct
3. **Gmail sending limits** - Gmail has daily sending limits (500 emails/day for free accounts)

### ‚ùå DON'T:
